## Overview

Maintenance Tracker App is a modern web application built with React, Node.js, and TypeScript, designed to help users efficiently organize, track, and manage maintenance tasks. Drawing on best practices in secure software development, this app provides a clean, intuitive interface for logging and categorizing tasks, with a foundation for rapid feature expansion.

**Core Features (v0.1 Beta):**
- **User Authentication:** Secure registration and login using JWT.
- **Task Management:** Create, view, update, and delete maintenance tasks.
- **Categories/Tags:** Assign tasks to categories such as plumbing, electrical, and more.

**Planned Features:**
- Due dates and notifications/reminders
- Task status tracking (pending, in-progress, done)
- Reporting and history views
- Multi-user support

This project demonstrates fast, iterative development with a focus on code quality, usability, and security. Feature requests and feedback are welcome as the app evolves!
